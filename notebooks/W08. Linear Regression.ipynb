In the case of a regression, the null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between our variables-- increasing $x$ has no effect on $y$. In other words, that the regression line is flat: $\\beta_1=0$ . A p-value of 0.05 means that the coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level. In our case, the p-value is 0.000 (note: this doesn't mean it's equal to zero, just very very small), and we can therefore reject the null hypothesis that $\\beta_1=0$ at the 1% confidence level. However, this isn't the end of the story-- remember our weird negative intercept, and the fact that our model explains less than 20% of the variation in hourly wages ($R^2=0.181$). For a good overview of what exactly a p-value is, and why we should be cautious when interpreting them, see this [journal article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532382/).\n"

Unlike a continuous variable, we're not interested in the change in $y$ that results from a 1 unit increase in $x$, since our units have no meaningful order. Instead, we'll have to pick one of the categories (called a **base category**/**reference category**), and compare each of the other categories in that variable against this one. You can specify the base category explicitly, or python will pick one for you. As such, for a categorical variable with $n$ categories, we get $n-1$ coefficeints which denote the change in $y$ associated with membership of a given category compared to the base category. For example, if we have a categorical variable with three levels $a, b, c$ where $a$ is the base category, we would get *two* coefficients: $\\beta_1 b$ and $\\beta_2 c$.
